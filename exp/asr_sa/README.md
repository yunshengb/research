# ASR-SA Pipeline

## Structure

```
speech/: audio files generated by kaldi tts, used as input to ASR
text/query.txt: 400 text queries generated by analyze.ipynb from [here](https://inclass.kaggle.com/c/si650winter11/data)
analyze.ipynb: analyze the raw data
asr_result_<ASR_model>.txt: raw data of ASR results (transcripts)
qa_result_<ASR_model>_<SA_name>.txt: raw data of SA results
data.txt: processed raw data (generated by analyze.ipynb)
*.png: diagrams used in analyze.ipynb

```

## Regenerate Data

This directory contains all the experimental data for the ASR-SA pipeline.
To reproduce them:

- ASR

`cd ../tester` and run the tester to generate raw data.
`mv` them into this directory, and run `analyze.ipynb` to process and visualize.
For details on how to generate raw data, refer to `../tester`. 

- LSTM and Google SA

Refer to [../../sa](../../sa) for details.
