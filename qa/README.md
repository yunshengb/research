# Question Answering

Currently test two implementations:

1. Google QA

Essentially google.com.

To test Google QA, manually enter the text query into `google.com`
and record the answer in the box at the top of the page if it exists
(which is the result from the QA engine, NOT regular links to web pages).

2. OpenEphyra

To deploy OpenEphyra, see the Lucida project.

To test OpenEphyra, see `exp/tester`.
