qa_result_<ASR_model>_<QA_name>.txt: raw data of QA results
data.txt: processed raw data (generated by analyze.ipynb)
diagram*: diagram used in analyze.ipynb
interesting.txt: interesting observations from the processed data (to gain intuition) 

```

## Usage

This directory contains all the experimental data for the ASR-QA pipeline.
To reproduce them, `cd ../tester` and run the tester to generate raw data.
`mv` them into this directory, and run `analyze.ipynb` to process and visualize.
For details on how to generate raw data, refer to `../tester`.
