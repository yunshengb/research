# Question Answering

Currently test two implementations:

- Google QA

Essentially google.com.

To test Google QA, manually enter the text query into `google.com`
and record the answer in the box at the top of the page if it exists
(which is the result from the QA engine, NOT regular links to web pages).

- OpenEphyra

To deploy OpenEphyra, see the Lucida project.
To test OpenEphyra, see `exp/tester`.
