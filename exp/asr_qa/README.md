# ASR-QA Pipeline

## Structure

```
speech/: audio files generated by kaldi tts, used as input to ASR
text/query.txt: 100 text queries with answers maded manually
analyze.ipynb: analyze the raw data
asr_result_<ASR_model>.txt: raw data of ASR results (transcripts)
qa_result_<ASR_model>_<QA_name>.txt: raw data of QA results
data.txt: processed raw data (generated by analyze.ipynb)
diagram*: diagram used in analyze.ipynb
interesting.txt: interesting observations from the processed data (to gain intuition) 

```

## Regenerate Data

This directory contains all the experimental data for the ASR-QA pipeline.
To reproduce them:

1. ASR and OpenEphyra

`cd ../tester` and run the tester to generate raw data.
`mv` them into this directory, and run `analyze.ipynb` to process and visualize.
For details on how to generate raw data, refer to `../tester`. 

2. Google QA

Manually enter the text query into `google.com`
and record the answer in the box at the top of the page if it exists
(which is the result from the QA engine, NOT links to web pages).
